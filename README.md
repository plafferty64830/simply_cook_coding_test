**React Native Developer - Case Study**
=======================================

Much of the recipe browsing experience for SimplyCook customers involves using carousels that scroll horizontally. Figma files for a typical carousel at SimplyCook.:[  ](https://www.figma.com/file/daCUNPZzpf17U64KsF5lSa/Recipe-carousel?node-id=7%3A757)<https://www.figma.com/file/daCUNPZzpf17U64KsF5lSa/Recipe-carousel?node-id=7%3A757>

Given our public 'recipes' API at[  ](https://simplycook.com/api/recipes)<https://simplycook.com/api/recipes> create a react native application that displays a card carousel control that:

- Displays only recipes that contain the allergens Crustaceans, Fish or Eggs

- Displays the recipe name, short description and image on the card

- When each card is clicked it should 'flip over' to reveal Cooking time, average rating, the top review text and a chilli heat level (0-3); when clicked again it should return to normal

- Don't worry about the favourite button in the designs.

- Don't worry too much about design at all, really - this is a tech task, not a design one!

You're not expected to know a lot about our business, our data or how we 'normally' do things - so ask all the clarifying questions you need to to help understand the task or navigate the recipes dataset.

You should upload any code to a GitHub repo for us to look over (or we can provide one, if needed). It'd be really great if you could share a working example ahead of your interview, but if not we can start with a quick live demo in the session.
